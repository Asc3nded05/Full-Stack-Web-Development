        <p>
            Growing up I've always been fascinated by computers and the wide array of diverse experiences <br>
            they can be used to create. In my sophomore year at West Irondequoit High School, I took my <br>
            first computer science class where I finally got to take a peek behind the curtain and start <br>
            my journey to understand how to use computers to create experiences of my own. Since then I <br>
            have continued to grow my programming knowledge and declared my Computer Science major at <br>
            Houghton University. Through this process I've used Java, Python, SQL and more to learn how to <br>
            create applications, simple servers, and databases. After finishing my Bachelors Degree at <br>
            Houghton University, I am planning on pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Science with the <br>
            hopes of entering the software engineering market after schooling. In the meantime, I am <br>
            currently researching summer internship opportunities to grow my experience and skills. <br>
